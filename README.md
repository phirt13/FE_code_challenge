## CodeFellows: Code Challenge

These are my answers to the Front-End DA problem set.

### Challenges:

  1. Build a Todo app using HTML, CSS and jQuery.

    * Your todo app should display a list of todo items as well as add, edit and delete them. Feel free to add to anything youâ€™d like to that application.

  2. Create a simple HTTP server using node.

    * This server should respond to a root-url request with a file called index.html. Do not use Express.js. Your code should have error checking and at least one callback. Put five or more html elements in your index.html. One of the elements should be a link to an external page. Things to research: node.js, callbacks, the fs module, the http module.

  3. Model a library using objects.

    * A library contains shelves. Shelves contain books. Books have an author and a title. Give the library methods to add and remove a shelf. A shelf should have methods to add/remove a book. Use a modular approach so that each type of object is contained in its own file. Add any functionality you think appropriate.
